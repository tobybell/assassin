# Assassin

This was a project I worked on briefly during my freshman year (2015-16) based on an idea I had with Ben and Marco from that Hackathon we went to in San Jose (that we didn't really enjoy and left pretty quickly from). The idea was to create an iPhone app version of the game *Assassin*, which would use some sort of sensor—Bluetooth, accelerometers, camera, we weren't sure—to allow the player to kill their friends, whose phones would also have the app. It was a cool idea, but in retrospect I am not sure iPhones really had or exposed the sensors necessary to make such a game work well. In either case, my momentum on it petered out after a bit. The work I did on this mostly ended up being visual design and maybe some basic networking to get the user login system working.
